research question - should be generalizable beyond the exact situation
- how can the game teach this concept
- can these games engage and promote learning?
- how useful is this skill
- amenable to creating a game
- amenable to pattern recognition skills
- don't have evidence of this yet
- breaking a problem into smaller parts
- will need to be somewhat tentative in these conclusions
